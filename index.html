                </h1>
                <p>
                    I've waited years to say your name and I'd have waited longer 
                    because prayers said in silence take some waiting for confirmation.
                    I've fallen in love with every part of you, slowly, surely and indefinitely.
                    You have me sinking effortlessly into all your foibles like quicksand 
                    and breathing through your laughter. A feeling I've come to love
                    is the way your voice caresses my senses for with every punctuation 
                    and every pause my heart beats with promise.
                    For even when I hadn't held you in my arms or looked into your eyes
                    I still felt contours of your body in the ridges of the spaces
                    I saved for you with accommodations for more. You crowd my daydreams
                    and you're sprinkled into my best dreams. Thus, every time I say your name
                    it is to implore you to stay here, amid all the love I've gathered for you,
                    for days and nights on end. ‚ù§Ô∏è

                            The evening at kuku caf√© was filled with so many emotions. As you opened up about your father and shared your grief
                            with me, it felt like the most vulnerable and beautiful moment we‚Äôve ever had. I held your hand through the tears, and even
                            though it was hard, I was grateful you trusted me enough to let me in. The food was great, but I barely noticed it
                            because all I could focus on was you. The waitress kept smiling, probably because, of the all the affection and
                            despite the heaviness,
                            we still found ways to laugh. ‚ù§Ô∏è

                        <p>Sitting at this cozy caf√©, surrounded by shelves of books and soft music, I watched you give your speech with such
                            grace and passion. You sipped on your ginger tea while I indulged in hot chocolate, losing myself in the words of the
                            pages in front of me. Even with our small disagreement, the moment was so simple, so perfect. Your voice, the music, the
                            warmth of the drinks ‚Äî it felt like everything around us melted away, leaving just us in our little world. ‚ù§Ô∏è

                            That afternoon at the caf√© was everything. You were putting the final touches on your book while I wrapped up my
                            project, but we kept getting distracted by people watching and laughing at our little bits of gossip. When we saw
                            that older couple with their daughter, 
                            it felt like a glimpse into something we‚Äôve always dreamed about together. Between
                            the work, the laughter, and those stolen glances, 
                            it was one of those simple, perfect moments that I‚Äôll always treasure. ‚ù§Ô∏è

            <br>
            From the moment we met, I knew my life would never be the same. I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to just let you go. Your smile,
            your kindness, and your warmth has filled my heart in ways I never imagined. Each day with you has been an adventure, a
            journey of love, laughter, and joy that I want to continue for the rest of my life.<br>
            <br>
            You are my greatest love, my best friend, and the one who makes me believe in all the magic the world has to offer. I
            have been lucky enough to just be around you but I hope to share in your triumphs, your dreams, and even the quiet
            moments where nothing matters except that we are together.<br>
            <br>
            I constantly think of a future‚Äî a future where we continue to grow, to support, and to love one another through every
            season of life. I want to be the one who holds your hand on this journey, the one who wakes up next to you every
            morning, the one who loves you completely and endlessly.<br>
            <br>
            So today, I want to ask you something that comes straight from my heart. <b> Will you be my girlfriend?</b> Not just my
            girlfriend but my person and the one God has proposed for me. Will you continue this beautiful adventure with me, side
            by side, through all that life brings?<br>
            <br>
            I promise to take care of you, to honour you, and to always be by your side. And I pray that together, we can build a
            life filled with love, laughter, and endless memories.<br>
            <br>
            With all my love, forever and always,<br>
